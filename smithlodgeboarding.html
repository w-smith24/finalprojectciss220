		<h2>Smith's Luxury Dog Hotel</h2>
		<h3>$29.99 a night or $189.99 a week</h3>
		<p>When we say boarding what we actually mean is dog resort. We don't just provide a place for you
		to leave your dog while you go away; we provide a luxury experience for your pet. We provide each dog 
		with it's own luxury room equipped with a TV, a couch and a nice cozy bed. But, that's not all. Each day your
		dog will be taken on multiple walks and (if your dog is "other dog" friendly) they have to opportunity to 
		socialize a bit. This gives them play time which equals exercise. With every weeks stay at our hotel you also get our 
		No Barks About It grooming package absolutely free. So, your dog is returned to you nice and shiny new.</p>

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>We only feed your dog the food that you normally feed them, but that doesn't mean you have to provide
      it. We stock a whole assortment of foods, and if we don't stock your food we go and get it. The dogs are always
      fed separately for safety reasons so, there is no reason to worry about fights.</p><br><br><br>

      <h2>Sleeping Arrangements</h2>
      <p>Each dog has their own room that they sleep in. In each room there is a couch and a bed so, your dog has 
      a choice of where they want to sleep. Both the Couch and the bed are memory foam so you be sure they
      will be comfortable throughout the night. And, if your dog is afraid of the dark or likes to watch TV while
      they go to sleep no worries because each room is equipped with a TV!</p><br><br><br>

      <h2>Social Time</h2>
      <p>If your dog likes to play with other dogs then we give them the opportunity to do so each and 
      everyday. We know the importance of socializing so, we give each dog the chance to play with other dogs 
      each day to keep them active, and so they don't get lonely. Your dog will get the chance to meet new friends
      each and every day. Life doesn't get much better than that.</p>
